Welcome to the home of the Mobile Health for Global Health Lab at Vanderbilt University! 

In the MHGH Lab, our research focuses on the development and implementation of software applications in global health settings. We believe that mobile phones and other connected devices have brought incredible opportunities to improve healthcare, particularly in places that haven’t had the resources necessary for quality care. Our core team approaches software development from a variety of diverse professional backgrounds, including engineering, chemistry, product development, and data science, but we embrace our collaborations with clinicians, epidemiologists, field scientists, and computer scientists. Above all, we are united by our belief that well-designed software can have a positive impact on human health.

Our group has a demonstrated track record of success operating at the unique interface of mobile and global health software development. We have ongoing collaborations outside of the Chemistry Department at Vanderbilt (Biomedical Engineering, Computer Science, Data Science Institute, Medical Center, Institute for Global Health), as well as beyond campus (Columbia University, Lurie’s Children’s Hospital in Chicago, Oxford University, Leiden University Medical Center, the Kenya Medical Research Institute, the Macha Research Trust). Our full-stack mHealth applications have solved problems in infectious disease surveillance (e.g., malaria, HIV, COVID-19, schistosomiasis), global health logistics (e.g., personnel, resource, scheduling management), data science (e.g., creation of “data-rich” environments with data capture apps, large-scale structured and unstructured data analysis, machine learning and model development), and mobile health infrastructure. We have received research support from the National Science Foundation, the National Institutes of Health, the Tennessee Center for AIDS Research, the Burroughs Wellcome Fund, Amazon Web Services, and Google Cloud. Software from our lab has been deployed domestically in the US (Nashville, Baltimore, New York, Chicago) and globally (Kenya, Zambia, South Africa, Côte d’Ivoire, Brazil).


I am a data scientist applying machine learning tools and causal
inference techniques to remote sensing data. I am also an affiliated
researcher with the [Data-driven Analysis of Peace Project](https://dapp-lab.org)
and a research collaborator with the 
[Research on International Policy Implementation Lab](https://bridgingthegapproject.org/ripil).

I earned my Ph.D in Political Science from the
[University *of* North Carolina *at* Chapel Hill](https://www.unc.edu) and my
B.A. in Political Science from [Haverford College](https://www.haverford.edu).
My academic work has been [published](publications) or is forthcoming in
*International Studies Quarterly*, *Conflict Management and Peace Science*,
*Political Science Research and Methods*, and *PS: Political Science & Politics*,
among other outlets. This [research](research) explores the causes and
consequences of political violence using a broad variety of methods such as
latent variable models, geospatial analysis, and big data. While primarily
focused on civil conflict, it also examines contentious political phenomena
including terrorism and economic statecraft, and develops new measures of
institutions in international relations. I have [teaching](teaching) experience
in both quantitative methodology and international relations, and am a certified
instructor with [The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org).
