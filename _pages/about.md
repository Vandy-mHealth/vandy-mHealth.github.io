Welcome to the home of the Mobile Health for Global Health Lab at Vanderbilt University! 

In the MHGH Lab, our research focuses on the development and implementation of software applications in global health settings. We believe that mobile phones and other connected devices have brought incredible opportunities to improve healthcare, particularly in places that havenâ€™t had the resources necessary for quality care. Our core team approaches software development from a variety of diverse professional backgrounds, including engineering, chemistry, product development, and data science, but we embrace our collaborations with clinicians, epidemiologists, field scientists, and computer scientists. Above all, we are united by our belief that well-designed software can have a positive impact on human health.
